\arguments{
\item{img}{CT scan in ANTs image file format}

\item{mask}{Mask of CT scan in ANTs image file format}

\item{sides}{Choose to calculate radiomic features on the right and/or left lungs. Note: Right lung = 1, left lung = 2, non-lung = 0}

\item{featuresFirst}{First level radiomic features to calculate}

\item{featuresSpatial}{Spatial radiomic features to calculate}

\item{partition}{Matrix of x, y, and z coordinates for each partition from partition_lung. If null, partition_lung is called.}

\item{kernel_size}{(If partition is null) Size of the kernel, in voxel units of width, depth, and height. Must be c(3,3,3) or greater. Default: c(30,30,30)}

\item{kernel_stride}{(If partition is null) Stride (or spacing) between kernels, in voxel units, for width, depth, and height. If kernel_stride = kernel_size, the partitions are non-overlapping. If stride = c(1,1,1), then each voxel is returned.}

\item{threshold}{Number of non-missing voxels needed to calculate radiomic features in each partition.}

\item{tidy}{Logical. If true, outputs a tidy dataframe with results. If false, outputs nested loop.}
}
\value{
Values from selected features for both left and right lungs
